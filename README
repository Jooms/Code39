# Code 39

A barcode generator using the Code 39 standard.

I built this with a student during their Senior Project.

They originally built it using QB64 and this is a remake in C++
using clearly-written code.

## PreRequisites

You must have SFML 3.0 installed https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/3.0.0/

You must link it in your g++ calls as well.

## Build

Here's how you build it on Mac:

```sh
g++ main.cpp -std=c++17 -I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sfml/3.0.0_1/include -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sfml/3.0.0_1/lib -o barcodes.out
```
